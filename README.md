I have ported this theme from a [codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/23/fullscreen-layout-with-page-transitions) article, for the [ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog platform as a basic framework for developers to tweak and make their own.

All respects go to the original developers and you can also check the original codrops [github repo](https://github.com/codrops/FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions)
